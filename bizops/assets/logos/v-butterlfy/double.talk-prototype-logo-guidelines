# double.talk — Prototype Logo Use Guide

> **Purpose**: Enable fast, confident use of the double.talk logo during prototyping, testing, and early internal alignment — with a shared understanding of *why* the mark works and how to apply it for both human and agent-focused experiences.

---

## 1. Brand Intent (One‑Sentence)
**double.talk enables a single human voice to be transformed, replicated, and broadcast clearly and accessibly across agentic systems and IVR environments.**

---

## 2. The Core Mark

### Visual Summary
- Symmetrical, butterfly‑like form
- Mirrored profiles suggesting dialogue and self‑reflection
- Subtle outward signal elements on one side

This mark intentionally balances **human warmth** with **system intelligence**.

---

## 3. Why This Mark Is Strong (Foundational Rationale)

### 🦋 Butterfly Symmetry — Agentic Cloning
- Instantly communicates **duplication without loss of identity**
- Mirrored faces imply:
  - conversation
  - delegation
  - self‑dialogue between agents
- The form feels *alive* — avoiding cold, corporate AI aesthetics

### 📡 Outer‑Band Signal Motifs — Broadcast & Reach
- Dots / lines imply controlled signal expansion
- Reads as:
  - voice amplification
  - IVR distribution
  - accessibility through clarity
- Subtle enough to disappear cleanly at small sizes

### 🎨 Blue → Purple Gradient — Trust + Intelligence
- Blue anchors accessibility, calm, reliability
- Purple introduces creativity, autonomy, intelligence
- Sits comfortably between healthcare, telecom, and AI tooling

**Net effect:** the logo encodes your *architecture* as visual metaphor.

## 4. Dual Usage Tracks

### Track A — Human‑First (Accessibility & IVR)
**Goal:** Reassurance, clarity, approachability

Recommended usage:
- Light background version
- Reduced or softened broadcast elements
- Larger clear‑space

Use in:
- IVR admin tools
- Accessibility documentation
- Healthcare / support‑facing materials

---

### Track B — Agent‑First (Developer & System Identity)
**Goal:** Autonomy, replication, scale

Recommended usage:
- Dark background version
- Visible broadcast lines or dots
- Tighter, more compact placement

Use in:
- Developer docs
- CLI tools
- Architecture diagrams
- AI‑forward demos

---

## 5. Light vs Dark Modes

### Light Mode
- Preferred for human‑facing experiences
- Emphasizes trust and legibility

### Dark Mode
- Preferred for agentic / technical contexts
- Enhances perceived depth and system intelligence

Both versions are first‑class citizens — neither is secondary.

---

## 6. Scaling & Simplification Rules

- **Large sizes**: full mark with broadcast elements
- **Medium sizes**: butterfly core only
- **Small sizes (favicon / IVR UI)**:
  - remove broadcast detail
  - keep high‑contrast silhouette

Never distort or skew the symmetry.

---

## 7. Motion (Optional, Future)
If animated:
- Only animate the *outward* signal side
- Slow, subtle ripple or pulse
- No rotation, no bounce

Motion should feel *assistive*, not attention‑seeking.

---

## 8. Legal & Practical Note
This guide and logo are **prototype‑safe**.

Before public launch or trademark filing:
- Re‑draw final SVG paths
- Lock spacing, color values, and contrast ratios

---

## 9. Internal North Star
> *“One voice, clearly amplified — without losing its humanity.”*

If a usage decision supports that sentence, it’s on‑brand.
